Mu Online Web:
Original CHINESE version of the game. How to use: Open 1, 2 and 3 bat files and browse to http://127.0.0.1/
You might need to modify .bat files to target correct executables.
Because game uses adobe flash you need to use a compatible browser like https://coowon.com/. Tested using version 1.6.8.0
