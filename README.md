Mu Online Web:
Original CHINESE version of the game. How to use: Open 1, 2 and 3 bat files and browse to http://127.0.0.1/
You might need to modify .bat files to target correct executables.
Because game uses adobe flash you need to use a compatible browser like https://coowon.com/. Working version of Coowon installer included in repository.

Translated files: https://forum.ragezone.com/threads/development-webgame-muonline.1146679/post-8923080
Translated DBs of the game. XLS and XML files are inside the mysql database. 

coowon_install_1.6.8.0.exe: browser that can still play flash games and can play this game, not all browsers with flash can play it.
